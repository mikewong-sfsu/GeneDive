  // If the mention is a search term then there is no ambiguity; the user found
  // what they were looking for.
  //
  // We add a synonym if the mention is not a search term but..
  // 1. It is a synonym of the search term (add the search term to clarify) OR
  // 2. It is a synonym of the common name (add the common name to clarify)
  //
  // If the mention is not a search term but it is a synonym of the search
  // term, then it's unclear to the user that the terms are interchangeable, so
  // we must explicitly label them as synonyms
  //
  // If the mention is not a search term but it is a common name, then there is
  // no ambiguity; the common name is taken at face value
  // 
  // Example: An e-mail directory. 
  // User searches for name "Mike Wong" and finds "Mike Wong mikewong@sfsu.edu"; 
  // there is no ambiguity, user found what they were searching for
  //
  // User searches for name "Mike Wong" and finds "Michael Wong mikewong@sfsu.edu";
  // if they don't know Mike == Michael, they may be confused
  //
  // User searches for name "Mike Wong" and finds "Mike Wong mikewong@130.212.10.204" 
  // If they didn't know that sfsu.edu is the common name for the IP address,
  // they may be confused; mikewong@130.212.10.204 (sfsu.edu) is helpful
